## Log

### 2026-10-20
- `@forerunner/runtime` core: capability tokens, enforcement hooks (budget, steps, wall clock, kill,
  tool allowlist, paths, domains, autonomy, secrets, injection wrapping, audit), session budget with
  the 80% rule and review reserve, kill switch (40 runs + 3 processes stopped under 2 s in test),
  in-process agent loop, Anthropic Messages adapter, Agent SDK driver, model ladder and retry
  ladder, brief validation, context compression baseline (ADR 0003), setup validators, `fr` CLI
  (setup, status, doctor, kill, dirs) with a cross-process kill file. 100+ unit tests.
- Shared UI scaffold (`apps/ui`), Tauri desktop and Android shells, approvals web skeleton.
  Desktop shell passes `cargo check` on Linux. Android SDK, NDK and Rust targets installed in the
  build box.
- Parallel wave 1 in progress (state, vault, billing, testenv provider/mail/git host, scripts,
  requirements, ADRs 0002/0003); wave 1b in progress (specialist registry and eval sets, voice,
  sandboxes). `docs/requirements.md` written: 228 requirements with IDs A.1–V.9.
- Progress report 1 posted to the contact issue (joelwellbournewood/Forerunner#1).

### 2026-10-19
- Repository created from empty. Monorepo scaffold, `@forerunner/platform` (paths, shell runner,
  simulated clock, redacting logger) with tests. ADR 0001 (stack). Local Postgres 16 and a
  Docker daemon are available in the build container; Tauri Linux system libraries installed.
- Human checklist reviewed: no build budget, no Anthropic API key, no subscription token, no
  Cloudflare token, no mailboxes, no voice keys, no signing certificate, no cloud host were
  provided. All logged in `BLOCKERS.md` with the stand-in in use. GitHub access to
  `joelwellbournewood/Forerunner` exists (push). Work continues with stand-ins.
